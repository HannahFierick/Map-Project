LinkNYC, a program founded by CityBridge in 2015 to bring free wifi to New Yorkers, has played a crucial role in accessible connectivity.
However, since their founding, they have been accused of failing to live up to their promises about serving low-income communities, and the majority of their stations remain in Manhattan.
</p>
<p>
In 2021, they pledged that Ninety percent of their new structures would be installed in the outer boroughs and above 96th Street in Manhattan to expand connectivity to underserved communities.
</p>
<p>
The controversey has also come from manhattan residents and local preservationists and the New York State Historic Preservation Office. Complaints say that the 32-foot tall LinkNYC 5G towers will obstruct intricate details on some of the historic buildings located in the West Village and the Upper East Side Neighborhoods.
</p>
<p>
LinkNYC eventually hopes to have upwards of 2,500 stations in Manhattan. Currently, there are 2,083
active stations across all 5 boroughs.
</p>

<p>
  “We deserve the best design possible for our streets, and to re-utilize the existing infrastructure, and that’s a big word that means street lights, newsstands, power pits, so it does not unduly affect the effects of a historic streetscape while still increasing broadband access,” preservation consultant Simeon Bankoff told NY1 in November. </P>
